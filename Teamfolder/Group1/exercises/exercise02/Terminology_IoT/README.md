# Terminology IoT

## Concepts

- Internet
- Server
- Clould (-computing)
- Edge (-computing)
- Fog (-computing)
- Swarm
- Things
- Gateway
- Nodes

### Connections between concepts

A thorough IoT architecture is created by connecting these ideas in a number of different ways:

Gateways are used to facilitate data collection and communication between IoT devices (Things and Nodes). By bringing processing close to the data source, edge and fog computing decrease latency and enhance real-time decision-making. 

IoT data is stored, processed, and accessed by servers on the cloud. IoT applications can also benefit from the collaborative and adaptive capabilities that concepts like swarms can bring. 

Naturally, the IoT ecosystem's connection between all of these components is facilitated by the internet, which acts as its connectivity backbone.
