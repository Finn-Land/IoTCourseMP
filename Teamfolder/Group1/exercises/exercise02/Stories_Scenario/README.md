## Persona
### Bio
Fred Watson is a talented digital designer who excels in the world of digital design while navigating the challenges of being deaf. 

Fred's dedication to creativity and innovation is an inspiration to both the deaf and hearing communities, making him a prominent figure in the field of digital design.

Recently, he has been interested in automating his home, but has had trouble finding a system that is not voice-based. He has been thinking about being able to control his house with his hands and gestures but he hasn’t found anything.

### Goals
- Advocate for greater accessibility in home automation for deaf people
- Advocate for gestures being normalised in home automation
- He wants to be able to “control” his house without needing a big size object like a controller.
- He would like to be able to open doors and others just with hand movements, prefereably gestures that are already associated to sing gestures, but that is not an important point.

### Pain Points
- Unable to use speak based assistants to control devices
- Fred's goal is to normalize gestures in home automation, but he may encounter resistance from both the industry and consumers who are not familiar with or hesitant to adopt this technology. Convincing people to embrace and understand these gestures can be a significant challenge.
- Struggles to find a variety of home automation products in the market that offer robust accessibility features tailored to their specific needs as a deaf individual. 

## Scenarios

### Opening a door
Fred lives in South Africa. He has a house with two bedrooms and zero automation.

He is now heading back home after buying groceries, his hands are full with the grocery bags. He leaves one of the bags on the ground, checking that no one suspicious is nearby, and quickly unlocks the door and grabs the doorknob to open his house.  He picks up the grocery bag, enters the house and looks in relief. 

He thinks about how uncomfortable it is to get scared every time someone takes advantage of his lack of hearing to steal from him, and he wishes to be able to get back home differently.

He can imagine himself wearing a bracelet, or maybe a ring, that allows him, with just a gesture, to unlock and open the door. Just a simple movement that recognizes a small device in his hand or arm and prevents him from leaving the bags on the floor.

### Turn on the lights
Fred is sitting in his living room during the early evening. The room is dim, and he needs to turn on the lights to brighten the space.

He raises his hand in a predefined gesture recognized by his home automation system to signify "turn on the lights."

The home automation system uses cameras and gesture recognition algorithms to interpret his hand gesture accurately.

Upon recognizing the gesture, the system triggers the lights in the living room to turn on, illuminating the space and meeting his requirement.

He can now enjoys a well-lit living room, enhancing his comfort and enabling him to engage in activities with ease
