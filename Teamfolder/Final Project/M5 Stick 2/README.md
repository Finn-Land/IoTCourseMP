display changes color up to 10 times every two seconds

level up: random color

1st: download the drivers
2nd: arduino and board
3rd: try if it works
4t write a code related to the activity (we divide it in different steps)
	one color
	try an array
	change the delay for millis
	making it random color
	adding a text

to make it more difficult we rotated and centered the text :)

and now vincent wants us to do mqtt which we dont know :(
