# Reflection 07

## Lecture reflection

This was the first day of no lectures. In the morning we discussed the project goals and what we wanted to do. Since we are making an online translator, we don't have much need for any IoT in our project. The final components that we ended up with after talking to the teacher were:

### Project idea
Also I disccused with my teammates what I wanted to do tomorrow and what ideas I had. Because the more IOT devices we have, the better our score. So I wrote down what we needed:

- RFID Scanner
- Two M5's
- RGB-LED
- OLED screen
- Buzzer

These are divided into 4 modules:

1. RFID reader
2. Alarm system, RGB-LED, buzzer and OLED screen
3. M5 to trigger on hand movement
4. M5 to react on hand movement on other M5's movement

The modules are further explained in the group portfolio.

### User story update
We didn't update the user story, since it's still relevant:

MEETING CALL

Fred is in his office, and he is really excited to be working for such an advanced company. Right now, he is working on a really important design, but he feels stuck. He has been staring at the same design for hours without being convinced of it. He decides he needs one of his colleagues' opinions.

What he loves about the company he is working for is their accessibility tools. He has a gyroscope in his right hand, and with that, he can easily call his colleague, Rebecca. Carefully, he moves his right hand and makes the sign to call her.

Rebecca is focused on her work when she feels a buzz in her left arm. She glances at it and sees her smartwatch with a notification of an upcoming meeting from his colleague and friend Fred.She presses one of the buttons, accepting the call. Her monitor displays the Sign Syncer translating site.

In another room, Fred, who, after requesting a meeting with Rebecca, kept working, feels a buzz from his own smartwatch. When he glances at it, he sees that Rebecca has accepted his call and that his desktop monitor is now on the Sign Syncer translating site.


## Lab reflection
No real lab reflection today. We didn't do that much on this day since people in the group were figuring out the payment for the dorms. There also weren't any labs to do so it was mostly thinking about the structure of the final project that we have to do, as you can see above.
