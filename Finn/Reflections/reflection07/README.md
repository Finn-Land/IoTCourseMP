# Reflection 07

## Lecture reflection

This was the first day of no lectures. In the morning we discussed the project goals and what we wanted to do. Since we are making an online translator, we don't have much need for any IoT in our project. The final components that we ended up with after talking to the teacher were:

Also I disccused with my teammates what I wanted to do tomorrow and what ideas I had. Because the more IOT devices we have, the better our score. So I wrote down what we needed:

- RFID Scanner
- Two M5's
- RGB-LED
- OLED screen
- Buzzer

These are divided into 4 modules:

1. RFID reader
2. Alarm system, RGB-LED, buzzer and OLED screen
3. M5 to trigger on hand movement
4. M5 to react on hand movement on other M5's movement

The modules are further explained in the group portfolio.


## Lab reflection
No real lab reflection today. We didn't do that much on this day since people in the group were figuring out the payment for the dorms. There also weren't any labs to do so it was mostly thinking about the structure of the final project that we have to do, as you can see above.
