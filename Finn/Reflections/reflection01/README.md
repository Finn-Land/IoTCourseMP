# Reflection day 1
## Lecture reflection
The first lecture of this module was the introduction to IoT. Having worked with IoT before and embedded systems, I found it to be quite refreshing. On this day I did feel quite bad, I had food poisoning and had to puke several times, hence why I left the classroom during an explanation. The lecture went through an explanation on IoT, some IoT domains, microcontrollers used and protocol examples. We also talked about the advantages/disadvantages that are present within the IoT field. 

## Lab reflection
The lab exercises on this day were relatively easy for the most part. I set up the GIT repository for my team, and explained to them how they can use the basics of GIT.
