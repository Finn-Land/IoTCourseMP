# Reflection day 3
## Lecture reflection
The first part of the lecture was to compare 5 data formats  used in IoT:
Text Data Format:
Text-based formats like plain text or CSV can be used in IoT for simple data exchange, especially when the data is human-readable and doesn't need complex structuring. However, they might not be efficient for transmitting large amounts of data or structured data.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language):
XML is a structured and extensible data format that can be suitable for IoT applications where data needs to be well-defined, organized, and easily parseable. However, XML can be more verbose compared to other formats like JSON and may require more bandwidth for communication.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
JSON is an efficient data format for IoT due to its lightweight, human-readable, and easy-to-parse structure. It's well-suited for IoT applications where data needs to be transmitted efficiently between devices and applications.

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language):
YAML is a human-readable and easily writable data serialization format. It's less verbose compared to XML and allows for a clear and structured representation of data. YAML can be a good choice in scenarios where human readability is important, and the data structures are moderately complex.

Binary Data Format:
Binary formats can be highly efficient for transmitting large amounts of data in IoT. They are compact and can significantly reduce bandwidth usage. However, they are not human-readable, which can make debugging and understanding the data more challenging.
