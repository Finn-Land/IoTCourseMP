## Lecture reflection
The first lecture of this module was the introduction to IoT. Having worked with IoT before and embedded systems, I found it to be quite refreshing. On this day I did feel quite bad, I had food poisoning and had to puke several times, hence why I left the classroom during an explanation. The lecture went through an explanation on IoT, some IoT domains, microcontrollers used and protocol examples. We also talked about the advantages/disadvantages that are present within the IoT field. 

## Lab reflection

### Setting up Raspberry PI
In order to set up our raspberry pi we first have to flash an SD card with a suitable rapsberry pi image. We got the image from the lecturer, we flashed this using a program called balenaEtcher. I have used this in the past before, it's easy to use but you can also the raspberry pi image flasher.
