# Reflection 05

## Lecture reflection
Questions to think about:

### Introduction questions
- **What will be the issues scaling up (system size, number of systems, management)?** 
    - You would need more MQTT topics. make them more defined.
    - Management is more difficult.
- **How can we do testing?**
    - Divide system into multiple units, test individually, then integrate and test together
- **What would you like to see for scaling up? (what is not so great currently?)**
    - More NODE-RED
    - Data effiency
- **What role will play simulator(-component)s, MQTT and stories?**
    - Simulation plays a big role, first you have to simulate in order to see if the idea is feasible.
    - MQTT would play a big role too, since the topics make it easy to see where which data is going.
