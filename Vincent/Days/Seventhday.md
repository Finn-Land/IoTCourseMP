# Day 7

Day 7, was an interessing day. As we didn't have any challenges to do, apart from our final project for the IOT module, which needed to be added to our project from the other modules. 

I don't have much to write today, as today I had personal issues with the payment of the dorm room.

The problem with that was that I had the money in cash, which, in the first mail we got from the accomidation, we could pay in cash, but they said we needed to do a bank transfer. 

Because I can't send that much money without a e-dentifier. A e-dentifier is a device that allows me to send a large amount of money to a person. Without it, I'm only allowed to send â‚¬250,-, which isnt enough. 

So I did have a lot of cash which I couldn't use. So in deliberation with the international office, I decided to go to a bank so that they could take the money and send it to the dorm administrator. But when we arrived at the bank I had a far better idea. 

I called my parents and asked them to send it to them. Altho I cant pay my parents right back now, but when I am back home in The Netherlands, I can give them the cash that I currently have. 

So at 12:15 it was finally fixed and paid the dorm.

# What DID i do today?

For the IoT part I made preparations for tomorrow, for our final project. Futhermore I ordered our hardware that we needed. 

Also I disccused with my teammates what I wanted to do tomorrow and what ideas I had. Because the more IOT devices we have, the better our score. So I wrote down what we needed:

- RFID Scanner
- M5
- another M5
- RGB-LED
- OLED screen
- Buzzer

The project that we did yesterday would in part return in our final project. We did it, because it suited in our project, and then we have more IOT devices for our project, which in return would mean we have a better final grade. 

The last two things I did today, were I got my teammates up to scratch, do they know what I wanted to do tomorrow.

The last thing I did today was continue my documentation, for the portfolio you are reading now, and for the ICC which needed to be done for school. 

# Feedback and reflection
## feebdack

There isn't anything I can really give feedback on this time. My teammates knew what needed to be done and the worked indepentenly on what they needed to do, which was documentation. So everyone today did their own thing. 

## Reflection

I think it was a good idea to take one day to catch up. So I think i made the right decision today to let everyone do their own thing. 

I'm glad that we have so much time today, so I can also catch up with my own documentation. Because I was yesterday so much time busy with the project, I haven't made time to write my portfolio and ICC, so I'm glad that I made time for it today.
