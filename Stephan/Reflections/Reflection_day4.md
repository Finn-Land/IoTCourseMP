### Reflection Day 4

Today we continued with what we were doing yesterday, but we had to use node-red as well.

# Node-Red

Node-RED is like a toolbox for making things work together on the internet. It helps people connect and control stuff like smart devices. Instead of writing a lot of code, you connect blocks that do different jobs, kind of like building with Lego. This makes it simple to create things like making your lights turn on automatically, processing data, or controlling devices. People often use Node-RED for making their homes smart or for managing machines in factories, making it easier to create custom solutions without needing to be a programming expert.
