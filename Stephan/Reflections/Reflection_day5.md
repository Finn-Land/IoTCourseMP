### Reflection Day 5

Today we had some questions to answer concerning scalability. Our group talked about the questions and these were the solutions we came up with.

# Questions

- **What will be issues scaling (system size, number of systems, management)**
    - Scaling isn't always favourable, because it requires more resources. When you need more resources you need to spend more money. Futhermore if you scale up you also require more bandwith from you network. Scaling up just ask more of your current network and places
- **How can we do testing?**
    - You could simulate it, when simualting a network and a area, you could get the speficis of requirements. However simulation is not always the best way to test it. another way of testing is to make the network in a exclusive zone, so your own network doesnt have hinder from changing things. You could also do one for one for one for one. 
- **What would you like to see for scaling up?**
    - What I would like is to scale the network up, currently we have a lot of issues with the way the network is programmend, but that can be resolved if we use good networking equipment. Futhermore I would like to have more Arduino stuff, because right now we have a little bit to little to little. As for the last thing, I would like for everyone to have there own Raspberry PI, not a PI 400, but a Pi 3/4 or 5. 
- **What role will play simulator (-component)s, MQTT and stories**
    - Simulating the hardware is a good way to test surten things. I simulate Node-Red for example and it's really handy to simulate it, because my laptop has enough power right now to work. So I could simulate other things as well.

# Task 1

This task we only had to read the documentation. Here are some notes on it:

IoTempire is a tool for exploring and using Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It has some important commands:

- "**use**" helps you pick a specific task for IoT.
- "**show**" gives information about tasks you can do or the one you're working on.
- "**set**" lets you adjust how a task works.
- "**unset**" removes changes you made.
- "**run**" makes a task happen with your adjustments.
- "**search**" looks for different tasks you can do.
- "**help**" shows how to use a command or task.
- "**back**" takes you back to the main menu.
- "**exit**" ends the IoTempire tool.

These commands help you control and explore IoT devices using IoTempire. Remember that the available tasks and commands can change over time, so check the latest info in the official documentation or from the IoTempire project to be up to date.
