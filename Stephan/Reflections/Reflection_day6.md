# Reflection Day 6

In day 6 of the course we had a short lecture in the morning about IotEmpower and how the file systems worked.
s
After the lecture we got back to doing the practical tasks. Me and Vincent had to continue from where we left of the previous day with the RFID reader since we didn't have the RFID readers to use on Friday.

## Access Control System
### First Task

We then started with the practical task that was assigned for the day, which was the access control part of the practical tasks. The first task was to control an LED with a slider using PWM. We had some trouble with flashing the esp32 correctly, because the framework was looking for a library which's name has since changed. After the problem was fixed we quickly finished the first task from access control.

### Second Task

The second task was to replace the LED with a buzzer and then control the buzzer with a slider. Since the task was to literally just replace the LED with the buzser the task was very easy and worked on the first try.

# Project 1

We started work on the Project 1 task. All of us worked on this together, but we ran into a lot of problems with our esp8266. It didn't want to flash and so we ended having to borrow an esp from The Big Five. After working the entire day we did not have enough time to finish it in class and so Vincent finished it in his room.
