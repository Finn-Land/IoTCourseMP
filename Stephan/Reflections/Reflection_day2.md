# Reflection Day 2

For the start of the second day we had to create user stories that would fit our project in the context of IoT.

## User Story
Vincent and I made one of the user stories:

Fred Watson comes back from a jog in the woods. He walks up to his front door of his new house. Because his new house is in Austria, it has a lot of IoT potential, he has made his life easier, he added things to make his life a lot easier. Since Fred Watson is born deaf, he wanted to use sign language to interact with his house. He walks to the front door of his house and makes the sign for “open” in front of his doorbell camera, and just like that the front door opens. 
Walking through the door he makes the sign for “close” in front of the camera in the hall and then the door closes behind him. Fred walks to his living room with the intention to go sit on the couch. He makes the sign for “light” in front of his camera, that has night vision, and then the light turns on in the living room and the night vision mode on the camera deactivates. He lies down on the couch tired from the jog and decides to turn on the TV. Fred makes the sign for “TV”, in front of his camera on the couch and then it turns on.
After cooking his dinner, Fred wants to go to bed, so he makes the sign for “TV” again at the same camera, and the tv power off. When walking upstairs, he want to put his house on the security system, so he makes the sign for “Alarm”, and the security system of his home turns on. Then makes the sign language for “Lights” in front of his bedroom camera, but in reverse and the lights inside his home turn off.
Fred looks at his monitor, that’s is always on, and see that the led strips are all red, so his TV is off, the door is closed and the alarm is on and the lights are off, so he lays in his bed and falls asleep. 

This story implies the use of IoT within the deaf community.

### Challenges we will face

Doing this we will be faced with certain challenges:

- Make the signs easy to recognize
- Reverse sign can be difficult
- What about the ethics of this 

### The possibilities for this project

- Make it reprogrammable
- Make it personalized 
- Make it unique and destinquestich 

# Architecture and Terminology of IoT

### Internet
The **Internet** is a vast network that interconnects numerous smaller networks, allowing them to communicate and share data online.

### Server
A **Server** is a dedicated hardware or software system designed to host and provide access to specific services, such as websites, applications, or data storage.

### Things
**Things** in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) can encompass a wide range of objects, including physical devices like refrigerators and flowerpots, as well as non-physical entities, as long as they have an interface and the capability to connect to the internet.

### Swarm
A **Swarm** refers to a collective grouping of nodes and things within an IoT network, often working together to achieve a common goal or purpose.

### Nodes
**Nodes** in the IoT ecosystem are the physical components that bridge the gap between the physical world and the internet, enabling the transmission of data from the physical environment to online networks.

### Cloud
The **Cloud** represents a virtual workspace or environment accessible over the internet, offering services such as data storage, computing power, and software applications.

### Gateway
A **Gateway** is a crucial component in IoT networks, serving as a connection point or bridge that enables devices and things to access and communicate with the broader internet.

### Edge Computing
**Edge Computing** is a computational approach that empowers devices to produce faster results by processing data locally as it is received, reducing the need for transmitting all data to a central cloud server. This approach is complemented by **Fog Computing**, which filters and stores essential information within the cloud after processing data from devices, managing the vast amounts of collected data effectively.

## Before the start of the challenges

Before we could start with the challenges we had to do some setup with the raspberry pi. I was struggling with the concept and had no idea where to even start. Luckily Vincent knows about the field and could easily show us what to do. He described the steps as follows:

- Open the Pi 400
- Flash the SD card
- put the image, with etcher on the SD
- Change the wifi.txt
  - in the wifi.txt you can change the SSID and the password in our case we used the following SSID

- Put the SD in the Pi 400
- Power on the Pi 400
