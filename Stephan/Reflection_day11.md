# Reflection Day 11

Today we worked on finishing the project for the presentation. Me and Judith worked on a Node-Red dashboard for the one M5 stick that will act as the smart watch. It will show when a call is incoming and will be able to end a call. We will be finishing the slides we use for the presentation. One is for showing the scenario and the other is showing how the entire project will work for the demo and all the connections between the devices and how they communicate.
