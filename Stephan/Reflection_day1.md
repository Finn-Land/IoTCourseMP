# Reflection Day 1

We started off the day with a lecture and then some taks in between that were questions. These tasks we either did together as a group or we were divided into sub-groups. The sub-groups that I worked in was Me and Vincent. I think we worked well together and luckily Vincent is experienced in this field and he could easily show me how to do something if I didn't know.

### What is IoT?

**IoT**, short for Internet of Things, refers to a network of small computing devices and boards, each typically designed to perform specific tasks, although some are capable of multitasking. Common examples of IoT devices include:

- Raspberry Pi
- Arduino
- ESP (Espressif)
- Orange Pi


### Three big domains that IoT is being used in.

- wearables:
            Smartwatches
            Smartglasses
- Smart home applications
            Smart TV
            Smart Fridge
            Smart Lamps
            Smart oven
            Smart vacuum cleaner
- Smart cities
            Lora wan
- Smart companies
            Hospitals
            Banks
            Governments

### Common protocols in IoT.

- MQTT (Message Queueing Telemetry Transport)
- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- XMPP (Extensive Messaging and Presence protocol)
- Websockets
- DDS (Data Distribution Service)

### Common IoT devices.

- Arduino
- ESP
- Raspberry Pi
- Amazon Echo
- Ring Doorbell
- Lora Wan

### Benefits of IoT

The benefits of IoT primarily revolve around enhancing the quality of life. While most tasks can be accomplished without it, IoT technology is primarily utilized to streamline and simplify these tasks. It contributes to various aspects, from efficient time management to the convenience of self-opening doors.

### Challenges of IoT

One of the primary challenges in the realm of IoT is security. Many IoT devices lack robust defenses against cyberattacks, posing significant risks to privacy and data security. Additionally, ethical concerns arise in the context of IoT, as it has the potential to erode privacy for individuals due to the proliferation of devices like cameras, motion sensors, heat sensors, and other data-gathering technologies.


## Lab Tasks

Since Vincent and I worked on the lab tasks together I will link to his document with the explenations to make it easier and be able to read it only once.
