# Reflection Day 7

Today we discussed what we are going to need for our final project and how we are going to implement it. We came to the conclussion that we are going to need:
- RFID Scanner
- M5
- another M5
- RGB-LED
- OLED screen
- Buzzer

We would be using much of the final lab task for our project and a lot of the code was then already done for it except for the m5 sticks.
