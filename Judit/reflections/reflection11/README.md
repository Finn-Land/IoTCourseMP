## Week 3

### Day 11

#### Lecture reflection

No lecture, so no reflection. Full project day.

#### Lab reflection
Today has been another good lab day. I worked again with Stephan, and we did really good stuff.

We worked on the node-red dashboard, and I think we really work as a team. It has been easy to work with him these two days, and I am glad about our progress.

We had some struggles, but the group tried to help us.

I think it has been a good last day and I am now more confident while using the knowledge I've learned these past weeks (including some programming in Arduino IDE, node-red, mqtt conections and some tiny details about IoTempower).
