## Week 2

### Day 8

#### Lecture reflection
There has been no lecture at all. Some discussions regarding the projecs, the level of knowledge from the students, and some more things.

It is safe to say that the most interensting part of the day has been the fire alarm. 

We left the building, for some stupid reason I left everything behind (incuding laptop, bag and my coat, which was not very wise).

We went back to class and discussed some more.

After that, we had a guest lecture. He explained us about his experience in the Bosh IoT group, and also about some prokects

#### Lab reflection
We got some hardware to work with, but the team was not focused on working together.

Instead we have been focused on personal work and some individual work project.

I had a meeting that lasted way more than expected, and I could not start working on the project.
