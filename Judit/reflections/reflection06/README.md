# Reflections

## Week 2

### Day 6

#### Lecture reflection
It is officially the sixth day of class, and I cannot say I feel like I know where I am or what I am doing. 
Sure, IoT stuff. Sure, working on a project. But how? no clue.

What have I learned today? I am not quite sure either. 
All I know is that most of the class has been about the IoTempower gateway.


#### Lab reflection
