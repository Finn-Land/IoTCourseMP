## Week 2

### Day 6

#### Lecture reflection
It is officially the sixth day of class, and I cannot say I feel like I know where I am or what I am doing. 
Sure, IoT stuff. Sure, working on a project. But how? no clue.

What have I learned today? I am not quite sure either. 
All I know is that most of the class has been about the IoTempower gateway.

We have done some research, but most of it is self centered in the IoTempower gateway.

#### Lab reflection
During the lab session, we finished friday's last activity and started today's activities. 

We haven't had major issues with them aside from having to wait for the other half of the group to deploy and sharing hardware. Another issue we had was the Wemos D1 mini. The board suddenly stopped working properly.
