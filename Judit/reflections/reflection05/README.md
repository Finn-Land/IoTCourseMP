# Reflections

## Week 1

### Day 5

#### Lecture reflection
During the first half of the class, we discused about some concepts and quesitons related to Scaling and Testing.

Then we took a small break, after that we began the Lab Session.

I have gained some knowledge on the barriers regarding the IoT world, as well as the issues generated by having lots amounts of devices, data and infrastructures.

#### Lab reflection
Lab has been a mess. Things were not properly set up, and since we are two groups working with the same hardware, we had to wait until the other group was done in order to start.
