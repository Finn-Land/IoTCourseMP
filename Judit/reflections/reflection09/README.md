## Week 3

### Day 9

#### Lecture reflection
The lecture has started with some basics of security. 

We first reviwed the components of IoT such as Sensors, Microcontrollers, Actuators and Gataways. Followed up by some examples of each.

After that, we focused on how to secure the network connections using SSL/TLS. On that topic, we learned about the identification of security risks and different methods to secure them.

#### Lab reflection
We did some activities but both the documents and the explanations where messy, very difficult to keep up with.
Some things could only be done by one person at the time, but noone cared to explain that. 
I did not enjoy the lab.
