# Reflections
[Other Reflections](../README.md)

## Week 1

### Day 4

#### Lecture reflection
The lecture has been short, it barely lasted two hours, and most of it was lab. I feel confident using node-red, even though it has a lot of nodes and possibilities, and sometimes is hard to know which node to use.

#### Lab reflection
Once again, the lab level of difficulty fluctuates. Most of the times we need easy solutions, but since I am a begginer it is hard to see those solutions quickly.

I helped Cristina, Jorrit and Luca with a small problem that they had in their code, it was actually a really dumb problem (a line was commented and they needed it)

For one of the activities, we had to setup a discord. This bot had to react to a button, and when pressed, send a message to the discord server. We created a node-red flow, and a code in visual studio to do that.

For the last activity, we had so send a message to the discord server, and that message had to triggers a real physical device to be switched on. What we did was turning on/off a LED.
