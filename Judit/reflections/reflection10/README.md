## Week 3

### Day 10

#### Lecture reflection

We continued where we left it the other day. Explained stuff that should had been explained the other day, and did more activities that were related to what we did yesterday.

More content related with the research in:

Once again, I did not enjoy the class. In fact, I felt overwhelmed by the amount of information and the lack of clear explanations.

#### Lab reflection
Today's lab has been so far the most exicietin one. 

Stefan and I worked together on the other M5 Stick C Plus. We had a really easy assignment (at least at the begining):

Change the color of the LCD display every 2 seconds. We had up to 10 colors.

I had a lot of fun working on it, since it is an activity more suitable for my level of knowledge. 

When we finished, we challenged us to pick a random color from an array, and then added some text.

After that, Vincent suggested we could try to make it listen to a topic. Stefan and I sepnt quite a lot of time working on that, and we could not sort it out.
