## Week 1

### Day 3

#### Lecture reflection
Today's lecture has been short. That's the best way to define it. Somehow, I think I understood most of what we did.

We started with the basics, with the properties of simple, digital and analog pin connections.

Then we started the data serialization and the formats. We did some research on text, XML, JSON, YAML and binary and ended up discussing the pros and cons of these.

After that, we learned a little about the IoT protocols and watched a few videos.

The videos were completely related to the lab activities, and I have fully understood most of them.

#### Lab reflection
The first activity was to use some of the knowledge gained from one of the videos using MQTT basic orders. 

We used a Mosquitto client on our laptops. Finn subscribed to the topic, and I published some messages on it. Then we did it the other way around.

After that, the level of difficulty increased by ten. 
Ulno explained to us the activity, and we agreed with him to use Node-Red to do it.

Finn and I created three components. The thermometer, the integrator, and the AC.

We interconnected the three components to create a simulation of the activity we had to implement later on.

Lastly, we successfully implemented the activity with the ESP32, the mini ESP32 and a temperature sensor. This last activity was extremely difficult to understand for me.
