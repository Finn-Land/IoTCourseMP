## Week 2

### Day 7

#### Lecture reflection
The lecure has last maximum five minutes. After that, we had to work on our projects or finish yesterdays activity. 

We had already finished yesterday's activity and we have zero materials for the group project. So all I can do is make sure the portfolio looks good.

However, we did discuss the group project with Ulno. Since we have an online translator, it is hard to find an IoT solution that is suitable for it. 

We somehow agreed that tomorrow we will work on the project, and use some items we already have here in class.

After that, I focused on updating and organazing my portfolio.

#### Lab reflection
We have worked on our group project.
We decided our project would be divided in different modules.
- Alarm system?
- An M5 used as a gesture recognizer. It will turn on or off one LED. 
- Another M5. This one 

To do all this, we will use the following components:
- RFID Scanner
- Two M5's
- RGB-LED
- OLED screen
- Buzzer

I also teamed up with Xavi and Cristina to do some lab tasks.
