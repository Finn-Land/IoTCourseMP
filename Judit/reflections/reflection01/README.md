## Week 1

### Day 1

#### Lecture reflection
The first day has been hard. It has been a lot of time in class trying to keep up with things I don't have a clue about. 

It requires a lot of effort for me since I barely know anything about IoT, and I feel like there is a huge distance between the rest of the group and me, but the only thing I can do is focus, pay attention, and do the assignments.

I have been able to enjoy a bit of the lecture, even though sometimes it was too fast.

I have learned that IoT is almost everywhere and that it makes a lot of things way easier, and most of the time, people who don't study this kind of thing don't even notice the impact IoT has in our lives. However, the IoT still has a lot of challenges to face.

#### Lab reflection
In my opinion, labs are always more interesting. You can have lots of trial and error.

I teamed up with Finn, and I helped the group link the folders (I still don't know if I have done it properly, but I think none of us knows). 

Finn and I have worked together on the activities, and we have successfully completed both the blink and the toggle led (this one with different outputs; in the first one, while the button was pressed, the red LED turned on and the yellow off; in the other one, we actually did the assignment and only activated the LED when the button was pressed).

Also, I have learned that "#define" works better to define the component and its pins, and that "INPUT-PULLUP" in the setup for the button sets the initial value to "HIGH".

Another thing I have learned is that you can use "Tinkercad" from Autodesk to try out your code and connections beforehand.
