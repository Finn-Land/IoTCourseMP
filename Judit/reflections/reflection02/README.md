# Reflections

## Week 1

### Day 2

#### Lecture reflection
It is the second day, and I am already lost. Well, maybe it is because everyone already knows what this is about, and I am still trying to wrap my mind around IoT.

I did not understand the first part of the class. Sure, I know why we use user personas and scenarios, but I did not understand why we are doing it again (yes, this time focused on the IoT, but still). Despite that, I am sure that these are the only things I will understand.

After the break and all the situations regarding our projects not having any IoT implementation and not having enough time for the project, we started setting up the Raspberry Pi 400. I understood something, but it was really hard to pay attention to the video when everyone around me was making noise and being loud.

Lastly, we did some research about IoT concepts such as the Internet, cloud, server, fog, etcetera. I did not know most of them, and I had a hard time figuring out the diagram (the group was not really in the collaboration mood, and since I barely knew anything about it, I constantly needed to Google up concepts and relations).

#### Lab reflection
As for the lab, the difficulty has increased with just a blink, and for someone with almost zero programming knowledge, it is really hard to follow. The worst thing is that I was not the only one struggling, everyone was.

The activities are poorly written down, which makes it hard for people outside this workflow to understand what they need to do.

Out of 4 activities, we just managed to complete 2 in a period of 3 hours. I have to admit, though, that we have an idea of how to start the third activity.

Overall, I am not enjoying the curve of learning because it is not a curve, it is a straight line that goes beyond my comprehension.
