## Node-red

### Basics
First, we made sure all the students had acces to node-red either via the Raspberry Pi or a local instalation. Then we watched a video from Ulrich. In this video, he explained some basic flows and components of Node Red. 

During the video, we took some breaks of it to make sure everyone was following his steps on node-red, and after that we went to the lab activities.

We did some activities related to node red, from rebuilding the codes from the MQTT-Integrator to use a Discord message to toggle a LED.
