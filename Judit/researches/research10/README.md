## Explore the SSL/TLS Configuration Options of mqttbroker

First, we need to open the PowerShell, and write down:

    ssh root@192....

We get asked our password: iotempire

Once we are connected, we write:

    mqttbroker
    
<img src="./mqtt/1.png"/>

After we can execute the next command:

    mqttbroker --help

<img src="./mqtt/2.png"/>

In here we get a list of the commands witha brief explanation, this will be useful for the activities.

### How to request a full "template" command line for mqttbroker?

<img src="./mqtt/TEMPLATE.png"/>

    --commandline-full

### How to retrief the current configuration of mqttbroker?

<img src="./mqtt/configfile.png"/>

    --s, --show-config

### How to write current configuration to a config file?

<img src="./mqtt/configfile.png"/>

    --s, --write-config [configfile]

### How many server instances (services) does the mqttbroker offer?

<img src="./mqtt/instances.png"/>

    legacyin
    tlsin
    legacyun
    mqtttlswebview
    mqttlegacywebview

### What type of service do the individual instances offer?

- **legacyin**

- **tlsin**

- **legacyun**

- **mqtttlswebview**connection Configuration of established connections 

- **mqttlegacywebview**


### Via which protocol are the individual instances accessible?

    SSL / TLS

### Do all server instances offer the same configuration sections (cathegories)?

    No

### Which section of the instances providing encrypted communication, provides the configuration option for SSL/TLS?

    MQTTTLSWebview

### What options can be configured for SSL/TLS encryption?

- Certificate chain file
- Certificate chain file
- Password for the certificate key file
- CA-certificate file
- CA-certificate directory
- Use default CA-certificate directory
- Cipher list
- OR combined SSL/TLS options
- SSL/TLS initialization timeout in seconds
- SSL/TLS shutdown timeout in seconds√ß

## Certificates

### Install XCA

1. Download XCA from its website https://hohnstaedt.de/xca/ and install it.
2. Start XCA.

### Certificate Management
First thing we had to do was create a new database. Once that was done, we were able to create new certificates.

We modified the section "Subject" as shown in the image:

<img src="./certificates/cert2.png"/>

On the bottom of that same section, we generate a new key and selected it.

After that, we went to the section "Extensions" and changed the default type to "Certified authority"

<img src="./certificates/cert3.png"/>

We continued by going to "Key Usage", there we selected two Key Usages as in the image:

<img src="./certificates/cert4.png"/>

After that we saved and exported the certificate. 

Then we created another certificate for the End Entity.

Once again, we modified the "Subject" section and generated a Key. 

<img src="./certificates/2cert1.png"/>

We went to the "Extensions" section and modified as shown in the image:

<img src="./certificates/2cert2,1.png"/>

This is how the section ended up looking like:
<img src="./certificates/2cert2.png"/>

We saved an once again we exported the certificate.

<img src="./certificates/3both certificates.png"/>

After that we exported the key.
<img src="./certificates/4keys.png"/>

Then the group added the certificate to the browse.
