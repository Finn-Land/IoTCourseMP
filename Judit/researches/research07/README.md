## Project
We have worked on our group project individually.

## User Stories Updated
We created a new user scenario related with our project. To do that, I asked my teamates some questions about the idea we talked with Ulno, trying to make them think about details like "how does our user call a specific person" and "how does this really relate with our translating site". They were not able to answer me, so I just decided those answers on my own.
Update stories

## Analog Touch Sensor
I teamed up with Cristina and Xavi to do this activity.

We followed one of Ulrich videos to create a touch sensor based on an attached cable that uses Node-Red flow to generate pressed and released messages on MQTT.

More information about the activity is documented on Cristina's portfolio:

## Moisture Sensor
Once again, I teamed with Cristina to do this activity.

More information about the activity is documented on Cristina's portfolio:
