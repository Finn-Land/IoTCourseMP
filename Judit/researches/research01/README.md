## Who are U?
Im Judith Farre, a 21 years old student from Spain. 

I am currently studying Digital Design and participainting in the International Minor in IT.

### What type of programming experience do you have?
I do not have a lot of experience in programming, even though I know a little about processing and java script.

### What have you done with micro controllers? Which ones have you used?
I have only used Arduino and ESP32.

### Which single board computers do you know/have you used?
None.

### Who is a maker or part of the maker community? What do you like/would you like about it?
Not me.

### What do you already know about IoT?
I don't know a lot about it, just that its objects connected to internet.

### What role do lectures play for you in university
Our lectures are compulsory, even though professors never say it. Also, most of it is self-taught.

At the beginning I was a little confused with all the amount of work we had, because in most of the classes we had to do everything by ourselves. After the first year, I was already used to the idea of doing multiple subjects on my own.

### What are your expectations from this class?
Understanding the basics and being able to implement the knowledge gained though the three weeks.


## IoT
***NOTE** The answers to the questions have been expanded after seeing the video from BOSCH and TIA.*

### What does Internet of Things entail?
Refers to the intercommunication of everyday objects, devices, and appliances to the internet, which allows them to exchange data.

### What are the challenges?
- Devices redundancy
- Data Security and privacy
- Compatibility
- Higher energy usage

## Some Knowledge

### Git
Finn has created the repository for the group, and I followed the one given as example to do my folder.

I wanted to follow the template as much as possible, since I think it is a good way of having everything organized.

#### Updating the local repository
>1. Open cmd
>2. Go to the repository address
>3. \git pull *(with this command, we download the changes made on the repository)*

#### Updating the online repository
>1. Open cmd on
>2. Go to the repository address
>3. \git add . *(adds all the things that werent on the repository yet)*
>4. \git commit -m "Input text" *(comment)*
>5. \git push origin main *(we updload to the main branch)*
