# Last Day

## Week 3

### Day 12

#### Presentation
The night before the presentation, I spent some time preparing some slides. I did this because noone in my group showed interest in taking the lead and speak about how we would organise the final presentation.

So when the moment to present come, I had already assigned all of them some slides and things to do.

Overall, I think our presentation was good. We focused on the important detail and left nothing unspoken.

During the presentation we faced some problems, like one of our boards constantly deciding to not work. However, Ulno helped us to solve it, we just had to put it further away from the router.

Also, we faced a problem where our RGB LED would go with something like a 0.5 seconds delay, making it show colors like purple sometimes.

The comments were good, we where given some recommendations like making the RFID reader less restrictive (right now, it only responds to 2 tags, if we had had more time, we could hava made it respond to others).

Another recomendation was 

Also, Ulno really liked our Personas and our Scenario.


#### Reflection
I had a lot of struggles during this module, I even wondered if I had taken the right decision about being part of this, and was really close to give up. But like hell I was gonna give up, so I cried and said "This shit is not gonna work by itself", and got back to work. 

This was a constant during the three weeks, and it only got better on the last 3 days of the module, when my mind finally started to understand stuff (also when I started pairing up with people with equal knowledge).

Working as a group was hard, finding a project was hard, and understanding this module was hard, but somehow we made all of this (okay, so understanding this was a me problem, but still).

Now that it has ended, I can say that I did not enjoyed it, but that it was lowkey useful. I mean, at least I ended up understanding the things happening.

I understand better MQTT communications, and I think I am pretty good at node-red (and making the dashboard look ugly). Also, I did some coding in Arduino IDE.
